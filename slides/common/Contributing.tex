  	  A workflow may break for a number of reasons:
  	  \begin{enumerate}
  	  	\item a program breaks
  	  	\item the workflow has an issue
  	  	\item a computer failure
  	  	\item a program version change breaks the workflow
  	  	\item some computer issue (e.\,g. disk failure) breaks the workflow

  \frametitle{What is the Nature of the Issue?}
  \texttt{Snakemake} helps you to identify the nature of an issue:
  \begin{enumerate}[<+->]
  	\item It will report to you in which \altverb{rule} the error occurred \textbf{and/or}
  	\item a so-called "traceback" to point the issue within its code.
  	\item The workflow will indicate log files on the screen.
  \end{enumerate}
  \pause
  \begin{docs}{Looking into Log Files}
  	Look into the log file. It \textit{should} tell you the error. \pause If not, report it to the workflow developer (next slides). 
  \end{docs}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Do I need a \texttt{GitHub} account?}
  Today many software projects are either hosted on the global git server, \texttt{GitHub}.
  \begin{docs}
  	If you want to report an issue or even contribute back to the project, you will need an account. \lhref{https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account}{This page} describes how. 
  \end{docs}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Reporting Cluster Issues}
	\begin{question}[Where to?]
	  Report them to your cluster admins (\includegraphics[height=\texorpdfstring{\fontcharht\font`\B}]{logos/mattermost.png} chat, \Email{} mail ticket, etc.)
	\end{question}
    \pause
    \begin{question}[What?]
      Inaccessible paths (file system issue), network issues, node failures, etc. 
    \end{question}
    \pause
    \begin{question}[How?]
      Give a meaningful statement. "I can't do \altverb{ls} on \altverb{/some/path}." is more meaningful than "The filesystem stopped working!"\newline
      \bcattention Check your \Email{}! Has some maintenance been scheduled?
    \end{question}	
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Reporting Application Issues}
	\begin{question}[Where to?]
		The issue tracker of your application (if any). 
	\end{question}
	\pause
	\begin{question}[What?]
		Any application specific error. Try running the application with the input and parameters specified in the workflow (get them with \altverb{snakemake -p} to print the shell command or other debug flags). If the application breaks, report the failure. Else, it might be the workflow.
	\end{question}
	\pause
	\begin{question}[How?]
		Indicate the error message and what is leading to it. If you need special input to reproduce the issue, upload the input somewhere or attach minimal input to the issue report.
	\end{question}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Reporting Workflow Issues}
	\begin{question}[Where to?]
		The issue tracker at your workflow. For \texttt{Snakemake} somewhere in the \lhref{https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog/}{catalog}. 
	\end{question}
	\pause
	\begin{question}[What?]
	   Check that it is you causing the error, e.\,g. undefined variables. \texttt{Snakemake} will inform you about the nature of the issue. Read the error output carefully. Report when sure it is not you.
	\end{question}
	\pause
	\begin{question}[How?]
		Indicate the error message and what is leading to it. If you need special input to reproduce the issue, upload the input somewhere or attach minimal input to the issue report.
	\end{question}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Reporting \texttt{Snakemake} Issues}
  \begin{question}[Where to?]
  	 The \lhref{https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake/issues}{issue tracker of the \texttt{Snakemake} project}.
  \end{question}	
  \pause
  \begin{question}[What?]
  	Clearly unexpected behaviour. Or tracebacks pointing to \texttt{Snakemake} itself. 
  \end{question}
  \pause
  \begin{question}[How?]
  	Indicate the error message and what is leading to it (e.\,g. the command line you used). If you need special input to reproduce the issue, upload the input somewhere or attach minimal input to the issue report.
  \end{question}

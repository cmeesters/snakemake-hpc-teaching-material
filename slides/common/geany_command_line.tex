	\frametitle{Choosing an Editor \ldots}
	\ldots can lead to "flame wars". In order to start working, we need an editor or an IDE \pause\newline
	You may use any available IDE or editor, for beginners we recommend these steps:
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item load your editor \altverb{geany} or \altverb{gedit} \emph{before} attempting to load modules in the same shell. Start it like
		\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, style=Shell]
$ geany & 
		\end{lstlisting}
		\item Best use a terminal multiplexer \textbf{or} multiple logins (otherwise you have to develop and execute in one shell).
	\end{itemize}

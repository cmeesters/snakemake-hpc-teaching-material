  Does our Workflow contain errors? We run a debug trial:
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, style=Shell]
$ snakemake --debug
  \end{lstlisting}
  \pause
  Some targets are already present, we want the entire workflow again:
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, style=Shell]
$ snakemake -c4 --forcerun
  \end{lstlisting}
  \begin{question}
  	What do you observe? Why \altverb{-c4}?
  \end{question}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{\HandsOn{Visualising the Output}}
  On Mogon the Linux distro is CentOS (or now AlmaLinux), which provides the \altverb{display}-program to display simple images. We shall invoke:
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, style=Shell]
$ display plots/quals.svg
  \end{lstlisting}
  The figure has no axis-labels.
  \begin{question}
  	What does the figure display?
  \end{question}
\end{frame}

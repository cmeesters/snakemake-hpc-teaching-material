"""
This is a utility script:
    It counts ALL '\section' entries in all *tex
    files in this folder. It does not expect one
    '\section' per file (even though there should
    only be one). BUT it will enforce one '\section'
    per file for downstream processing!
    Finally it adapts the outline, in all *tex
    files to be split according the the section
    count.

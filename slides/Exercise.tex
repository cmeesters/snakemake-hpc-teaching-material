  \frametitle{\HandsOn{Writing an Archiving Rule}}
  Imaging you want to ``tarball'' all your data for archiving purposes. The command would be:
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash, style=Shell]
tar czvf <tarfilename>.tar.gz \
    <list of input (directories)>
  \end{lstlisting}
  \pause
  \task{Write a rule \texttt{make\_archive} using all \texttt{dat}-files and all plots as inputs, including \texttt{results.txt}.}
  \hint[Hints]{\begin{itemize}
                \item Use \texttt{07\_Snakefile} as a template. It contains a new plotting rule, too.
                \item Use the \texttt{expand()}-function to get the directories contents.
                \item What do you need to change in the \texttt{all} rule to run the entire workflow?
               \end{itemize}}

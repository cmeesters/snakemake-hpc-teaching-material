\frametitle{Running Workflows on Cluster (or other environment)}
  Most likely a specific workflow never has been testing on \emph{your} computer before. It is almost ensured it will run on arbitrary servers, but clusters are a different story. \newline
  So
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
   \item try to parameterize your workflow as learned
   \item if it gives issues and you know how to correct it, ``fork'' the worklow and create a pull request
   \item if you cannot fix it, create a bug report
  \end{itemize}
